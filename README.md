## ✨ Features

This is not just a standard checklist. It's designed to help you become aware of your daily automatic behaviors.

* **Habit Scoring:** Mark habits as positive (`+`), negative (`-`), or neutral (`=`) to see your daily net score.
* **Smart Voice Logging:** Tap the microphone and say things like *"I drank a glass of water"* or *"Read for 20 minutes"*. The app uses a local semantic engine to understand you and log the correct habit instantly.
* **Hydration & Time Tracking:** Automatically extract quantities (oz, ml) and durations (minutes, hours) from voice commands or enter them manually.
* **Deep Analysis:** Get insights into your daily routine, including:
    * Net Habit Score.
    * Most active times of day (morning, afternoon, evening, night).
    * Total water intake vs daily goal.
    * Time spent on key categories (Exercise, Reading, Meditation, Chores, TV, Social Media).
* **100% Private:** All data, including voice processing, happens right on your device. Nothing is ever sent to a server.
